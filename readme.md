Acute Medical Take Modelling Project

Aims: 
- Model the acute take in a hospital setting
- Build a front end to allow users to alter parameters for the take to optimise
patient flow and investigate reasons behind 

I have initially built the patient flows separately with SDEC, ED and medically expected patients seen in ED as separate models, which I will then combine to 
model the doctor resource being pulled across all 3 elements.
